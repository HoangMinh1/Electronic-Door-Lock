The project itself mostly are not done by me. Most of the code for Android phone and Arduino are done by Nick.
I leaved it here to respect Nick as I don't want to take his work for my credit.
I am the one who edited paper and assembled everything at the end. The project at that time was something that beyond my capabilities.
However, I put it here as something that I tried it to learn
